TO DO:
-when typing, check to see if it matches a target and if not ask for the option again
  - class choices
  - move selection
  - target choices

-replace showing stats that are incoming with one show stats function in the persona class

-in Combat:
  -create conditions for check checkContinue
  -make actions deal damage
  -identify position to check if the fighters are able to continue or should be removed from Combat
  -replace fighter ints and new int order with a list of tuples and sort start by descending it


Clean UP:
-show stats function doesn't operate player_Turn

-remove helper prints and replace with notes

-many dice rolls are currently being used as a place holder to see what the functions actually do but should now be removed

-text is very choppy and .format can be used to clean it up
